Deep Learning :
-----------------
key points :
    -neural network
    -Actuation function
        Three types of Actuation functions :
            1. inputs 
            2.hidden layers
            3.outputs
    -Back propegation 




    4. health care systems- like finding diseases cancers etc..
    5. finance applications - like Stock market predictions,and fraud currancy Dedection.


Deep learning frameworks:

the following deep learning frameworks or the most commonly used in the market...
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. TensorFlow
    2.PyTorch
    3.keras

TensorFlow:
------------

-> TensorFlow is a powerful library that allows developers to build and train the machine learning Models efficiently.

->It works with Tensors which are multi-dimentional arrays and supports both CPU and GPU exilaration for High performance Computations.

    Key features of TensorFlow:
    -.-.-.-.-.-..-.-.-.-.-.-.-.
    -> Scalibility --: It works on a verity of devices form mobilephoneslarge scale Distributed       systems.

    ->Flexible Architecture --: It can build models using I-level API's like keras.
